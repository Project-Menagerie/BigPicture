We're here to cut through the noise. Project Menagerie is all about getting back to basics and using what works. We believe in the power of plain text and in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). It's simple, it's flexible, and everybody can use it. Building on that with Git to make sure every change is safe and sound, so you can work without worry. This isn't about adding layers of complexity; it's about making things easier and putting you back in control of your data.

We're tapping into something that people already know and love, and we're making it better.

You don't want bloated software that tries to do too much and ends up complicating your workflow. You want something that just works.

We're here to deliver. Project Menagerie is your tool, built on principles we believe in. We're keeping it straightforward.

When it comes to managing projects, simpler is better. Join us, and let's make some thing amazing happen.
