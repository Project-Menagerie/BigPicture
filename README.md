In a world where the complex reigns,
Software giants build their chains,
Project management, a daunting quest,
With tools and features, none the best.

In the land of giants, where boards are king,
A titan's echo, a daunting ring.
Yet beneath the crown, a labyrinth lies,
A maze of tickets, and digital skies.

Admidst the noise there shines a light,
Small, but growing, shining bright.
The answer not in towers tall,
But something accessible to all.

A simple text file might suffice,
Using tested tools, keen and precise.
In our search for answers grand,
The simplest solution, right at hand.
